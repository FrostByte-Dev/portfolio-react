# React Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio site migrated to Vite React, which utilizes Yarn as the package manager.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- Yarn (version 1 or above)

## Getting Started

To get started with developing and running the portfolio site, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal at the root of the project.
3. Install the project dependencies

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the dev server by running the following command:

    ```shell
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite dev server and provide you with the link the React app is being served from.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `yarn dev`: Starts the dev server.
- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production. The output will be stored in the `dist` folder.
- `yarn serve`: Serves the production build from the `dist` folder.
